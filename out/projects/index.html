They seemed like a very cool approach to parametric polymorphism that I had not seen before! I created a JavaScript implementation of the basic multimethods to better understand how they work.</p>

We also use Pull Request workflow on Github, where PRs <em>also</em> have a status. I grew weary of having to check two places to figure out what status a PR was in (review requested? changes requested? merged?). I created this proof of concept to automatically transition tickets on Jira when the Github PR status changed. This allowed me to see ticket status viewing <em>only</em> Jira, which automatically reflected the up-to-date status of PRs on Github.</p>

The framework relies on lots of fairly complex JSON configuration files, and working on these files forces one to refer frequently back to the (also fairly complex) documentation. To address this challenge, I captured settings for the most frequently used configuration files in <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON Schema</a>, then created a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a> extension that automatically maps each schema to the appropriate LoopBack configuration file, providing the user with inline code hints, documentation, and warnings when illegal configuration values are set. &quot;If you can&#39;t bring <abbr title='the developer'>Mohammed</abbr> to <abbr title='the documentation'>the mountain</abbr>, bring <abbr title='the documentation'>the mountain</abbr> to <abbr title='the developer'>Mohammed</abbr>!&quot;</p>

Functionally speaking, this meant creating a map annotator that allowed users to add <strong>paths</strong>, <strong>polygons</strong> (&quot;areas&quot;), and <strong>points</strong> of various visual styles. I used Leaflet.js and its &quot;editable&quot; plugin for basic annotation mechanics, and added my own special hacks to allow multiple path &amp; point styles on one map, as Leaflet does not support this by default. It was quite a fun exercise!</p>

Take a look at the repo <code>src/index.js</code> file for the meat of this website builder.</p>

I made this primarily for workshops teaching <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, but it could be useful if you have need for random errors in your site!</p>

The purpose is to illustrate the execution times of blocking I/O + threads vs. non-blocking I/O + event loop visually.</p>

I fleshed it out with features primarily as a case-study for a 2015 <a href="http://2015.empirejs.org/">Empire JS</a> talk.</p>

Moving from demo to demo it&#39;s easy to forget to e.g. turn <code>mongod</code> on locally, so I made this li&#39;l utility to check that a process is running &amp; exit if it&#39;s not (fail immediately).</p>
</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/checkrunning">NPM</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Sequoia/checkrunning">Repo</a></li></ul><h2 id="repostats"><a href="#repostats" class="header-anchor"></a>repostats</h2><p><p>This was fun to build! A client needed me to gather statistics on some packages in NPM &amp; repos on github &amp; put it a google doc, so I wrote a script to do it. It was a bit tricky getting everything all Promisified, particularly the <a href="https://github.com/Sequoia/repostats/blob/master/src/sheets.js">google sheets API</a> but it worked out in the end. Also played a lot with FP style here.</p>
</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Sequoia/repostats">Repo</a></li></ul><h2 id="find-common-slides"><a href="#find-common-slides" class="header-anchor"></a>find common slides</h2><p><p>Client had a loooot of <a href="https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js">Reveal.js</a> slide decks across 40 or so markdown files. The decks had lot of duplication in them and it was up to me to find duplicate slide(s) &amp; externalize them. I tried <em>everything I could think of</em> before writing a custom script, but eventually I had to write a custom script. :) Lots of maps &amp; reduces in there... plenty.</p>
</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/Sequoia/findcommonslides/blob/master/src/index.js">Repo (main script)</a></li></ul><h2 id="iot-chicken-enclosure-door"><a href="#iot-chicken-enclosure-door" class="header-anchor"></a>IoT Chicken Enclosure Door</h2><p><p>I was tired of having to go out to my back yard to check whether we&#39;d closed the chickens in at night, so I made this tool with a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13231">SparkFun ESP8266 Thing</a>. Basically the device reads the open/closed state of a door with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor">hall sensor</a>, pushes new states to <code>data.sparkfun.com</code>, then when you go to the output page (hosted on github) it reads from data.sparkfun &amp; tells you whether the door&#39;s open or closed! So ESP8266+github.io+data.sparkfun.com = <strong>cluck</strong>.</p>

I was thrilled when I was told it &quot;could even be a CLI,&quot; as that greatly simplified things! No html, css, etc., just text in text out. Had fun with commander, superagent, cli-table &amp; more-- this is what inspired my later CLI building talk!</p>

It was lots of fun &amp; a hundred or so people came. Did it again the following year then moved on to other things. I learned a lot about organizing, getting sponsorship, and event planning from this.</p>

I struggled with how to organize content so it would be useful to beginners and to experts; ultimately I decided to split the day in half: beginner stuff in morning, intermediate in afternoon. It worked pretty well! Had fun, had sponsor $ so attendees attended &amp; ate free &amp; I was able to pay an honorarium to the trainers (myself included). Win-win-win! Can&#39;t wait for International Day 2016. :)</p>

I had mostly used Javascript with jQuery when I started this project so I started the project with the goal of going no-jQuery, all browser APIs. It was fun &amp; I learned a lot! Unfortunately, because the project relied on facebook &amp; its markup, it would require updates every time facebook changed their markup, so the bookmarklet probably doesn&#39;t work today.</p>

It&#39;s very rudimentary, was written oringally for node version... 0.3 maybe? Also I never got it to work fully. README excerpt: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This project is something I created because I wanted to open links on my host windows machine web browser from an ssh session in putty. A friend (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/darcy-parker-a18804">Darcy</a>) suggested a node server et voilà, ForTheWindows was born. It&#39;s a node.js server that accepts requests (from curl in my case) and performs an action in windows.</p>
