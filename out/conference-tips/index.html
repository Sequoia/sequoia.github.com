    🥗 Bring Food</h2><p>Conferences are usually catered, but many catering services, well, leave something to be desired. In particular, breakfasts can be rough: pastries, fruit, more pastries... you get the idea. Eating a healthy breakfast that makes you feel good is <strong>more than just a luxury</strong> when travelling: it can be the difference between having a good morning and a crummy one. Take care of your body at meal-time and it will take care of you later!</p>
<p>When I arrive in a new town for a conference that I will be spending more that one night at, immediately after checking into the hotel I head to the grocery store for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fruit</li>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>Apples</li>
<li>Yogurt</li>
</ul>
<p>Plane travel, being in a new place, eating out three times a day&mdash;<strong>this is all hard on your body</strong>! Not to mention your wallet and brain. Sometimes siting quietly and eating a simple meal beats another hour of socializing over beers &amp; burgers. That&#39;s where the fruit, bread, and cheese come in: when you need food and a quiet break, you have a meal ready in your hotel room.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&#39;t be 100% reliant on conference catering</li>
<li>Have a meal or two on hand to save money and brainwaves when you&#39;re tired &amp; hungry</li>
</ol>

    🏃‍♀️ Pace Yourself!</h2><p>The first couple conferences I went to, I had my <em>whole</em> day planned out: this talk at 9:00am, that one at 10:00, then 11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00... this is crazy! Remember: <strong>there&#39;s a limit to how much you can take in</strong>. If you do attend eight talks in a day, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll be able to really focus on what you&#39;re hearing at all of them. Rather than power through eight talks in a day, pick four and give each of them your full attention&mdash;you&#39;ll get more out of it overall.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="Fear Of Missing Out">FOMO</abbr> is strong, but no matter how hard you try I guarantee you&#39;ll be missing something. So take my advice and stop worrying about it! Rather than stressing about everything you &quot;missed,&quot; you&#39;ll have a much better time if you set realistic expectations and give yourself breaks. So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Limit the number of talks per day to something reasonable (for me this is about 4 talks)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t worry about missing talks! There are always more talks. 😊</li>
<li>Take a break when you&#39;re feeling tired or frazzled. You&#39;ll enjoy the rest of the day a lot more!</li>
</ol>
<p>What to do when you&#39;re not in talks?</p>
<ul>
<li>Get some exercise at the hotel gym or walking outside</li>
<li>If you&#39;re tired: take a nap</li>
<li>Follow up on notes or questions gathered at talks</li>

    👨‍💻 Put Your Laptop Away</h2><p>It&#39;s tempting to google the topic being presented, check twitter, email, try to run the code examples etc.. <strong>You do not need to travel to a conference to do this.</strong> As such, it is (in my opinion) a poor use of conference time. If you&#39;re watching a talk, tune in and pay attention! If the talk is really so uninteresting that you don&#39;t feel the need to pay attention, why stay? There are usually better places to sit and work than an auditorium seat.</p>

    <a class="header-anchor" href="#-take-notes-on-paper">
      <span class="header-link"></span>
    </a>
    📝 Take Notes on Paper</h2><p>Taking notes is a great way to remember what you heard, note things you want to look up later, and to capture follow-up questions. So take out your laptop and fire up Evernote, right? Wrong! When you get out your computer, <strong>it&#39;s really hard to stick to just taking notes</strong>. When you&#39;re taking notes on your computer, and you have a question, and the talk is a bit slow, and it will only take <em>just a second</em> to find the answer on google... </p>
<p>Carrying a pen or pencil and a notebook is a great strategy for those of us who are easily distracted by the wide internet. If you&#39;ve never tried this remove-the-temptation strategy, <strong>you may be surprised how much more you get you get out of a talk when you give it 100% of your attention</strong>. Paper notes <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/taking-notes-by-hand-could-improve-memory-wt/">may help you retain the information better</a>, and they&#39;re useful whilst chatting at the after-party: peek at your notebook to easily recall insights and questions. (Bonus: it makes you look super organized! 😄)</p>

    </a>
    🚶‍♀️ Don&#39;t Be Afraid to Leave A Talk</h2><p>I used to feel like I had to &quot;commit to&quot; a session I was watching, or that if I missed the beginning of a session it was pointless to join late. Not true! If you get five minutes into watching a talk and realize it&#39;s not what you expected or you just change your mind, <strong>quietly slip out &amp; try another talk.</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit that as a speaker, it&#39;s not my favorite thing to see people walking out of a talk I&#39;m giving. However, I know that <strong>you&#39;re at the conference to learn new things, not to flatter conference speakers</strong>. You don&#39;t owe it to anyone to sit through a talk. Furthermore, if my talk is bad and everyone sits through it just to be polite, I&#39;ll never know it&#39;s bad. Do speakers the courtesy of giving them honest feedback: if a talk is bad, don&#39;t sit through it, be honest and walk out! You&#39;ll be doing yourself and the speaker a favor.</p>

    </a>
    ⌛️ Don&#39;t Linger</h2><p>This one really comes down to personal preference, but I&#39;ve found that sticking around for the conference closing party or staying an extra day to visit the host city is rarely worth the extra time in the hotel. I used to extend trips a night or two for this reason, but I am usually so exhausted after a conference it&#39;s hard to enjoy being a tourist, and I&#39;ve found that the value of sleeping in my own bed sooner almost always outweighs the value of another evening of schmoozing.</p>
<p>There is definitely a point of diminishing returns at the end of a conference: the crowd starts to thin out, the vendors pack up, and eventually there&#39;s naught left but a lone nerd, tinkering with a new framework at an empty buffet table, or wandering the vendor floor aimlessly with her sponsor shirt and enormous backpack. It&#39;s a bit depressing, frankly. 😛 Don&#39;t feel the need to stay &#39;til the bitter end!</p>
<p>These days I try to get a flight out as close to after-closing-ceremonies as possible, or a bit before if the other option is staying an extra night.</p>

    </a>
    💬 Hallway Track</h2><p>You&#39;ve probably heard this old chestnut, but it bears repeating: <strong>there&#39;s a lot more value in conferences than what you get from attending talks</strong>. Networking, trading tips, finding job leads, and making new friends: these are all things you&#39;ll find on &quot;the hallway track,&quot; i.e. by hanging out in the hallway, chatting with your peers. Conferences are <strong>the best</strong> venue for networking (read: &quot;finding work&quot;) I&#39;ve found, but you won&#39;t access this value if you&#39;re in talks all day. To get the most out of your experience, be sure to make time for the hallway track!</p>
