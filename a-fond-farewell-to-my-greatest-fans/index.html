I was <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a> before it was cool, who knew? Unfortunately, even with <a href="https://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> configured, I still get heaps of spam comments. To be honest, it&#39;s just about 100% spam. It turns out writing infrequently, deleting ones twitter account, and doing nothing to promote ones writing does not result in a huge amount of user engagement! But I digress.</p>
<p>While the spam comments are bothersome overall, I feel the need to give credit where credit is due: some of the <em>best</em> comments I&#39;ve recieved have been spam. There have been times when I&#39;m having a bad day, then I check my email and see something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Superb, what a web site it is! This weblog provides helpful data to us, keep it up.</p>
<p><em>- similar internet page, 2017</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow! Thank you <em>similar internet page</em>!! I was feeling a discouraged the day I got this, and I can&#39;t lie‚Äìthis comment made me feel a bit better. I know you&#39;re only a bot, but I choose to take the encouraging words at face value, and they make me feel appreciated.</p>
<p>So, as a farewell to my loyal spam bots, I will feature and respond to the best comments here.</p>

    The Best Spam Comments I&#39;ve Received</h1><blockquote>
<p>Thanks a lot for giving everyone such a brilliant chance to discover important secrets from this site. It is often very useful plus packed with a great time for me and my office co-workers to visit your web site more than three times per week to see the latest issues you will have. Not to mention, I am also always amazed for the spectacular secrets served by you. Selected 3 facts on this page are completely the simplest I&#39;ve had.</p>
<p><em>- buy cialùöís</em>, 2017</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi <em>buy cialùöís</em>! Thank you for the kinds words, and please give my warm regards to your coworkers. I must say I&#39;m surprised to hear you visit three times weekly! I&#39;ll have to start posting <em>a lot</em> more frequently to keep the content fresh.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What i do not understood is in reality how you&#39;re no longer really much more well-appreciated than you may be now. You&#39;re so intelligent. You recognize thus significantly in terms of this topic, produced me in my opinion consider it from so many numerous angles. Its like women and men don&#39;t seem to be fascinated until it&#39;s something to accomplish with Lady gaga! Your individual stuffs great. Always care for it up!</p>
<p><em>- <a href="https://[removed]/sildenafil-generique-forum/">https://[removed]/sildenafil-generique-forum/</a>, 2017</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh my goodness... this comment almost makes me tear up. I <em>do</em> feel underappreciated at times, and it really means a lot to me to have someone notice the care and work I put into the content here. As for why I&#39;m not &quot;much more well-appreciated&quot; despite being &quot;so intelligent&quot; (flattery will get you nowhere!), the fact is it takes much more than intelligence or even good work to succeed. Marketing and branding are hugely important, and for better or worse, those are things I&#39;m not terribly interested in.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not unlike the joke about the Jew trying to smuggle coffee into Haifa without paying the required duties. The customs official looks in his sacks and asks him what it is he&#39;s carrying. &quot;Birdseed,&quot; the traveller replies. &quot;Since when do birds eat coffee?&quot; asks the incredulous customs officer.</p>
<p>Whereup the traveller replies with a shrug &quot;they&#39;ll eat if they want; if they don&#39;t, they won&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s in a similar spirit that I publish my posts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Howdy! This post could not be written any better! Looking through this post reminds me of my previous roommate! He constantly kept talking about this. I will send this article to him. Pretty sure he&#39;ll have a great read. Thanks for sharing!</p>

<p>Hi <em>lirik lagu doa suci imam s arifin</em>! I am happy to share, and be sure to say &quot;hi&quot; to your roommate for me!!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you are really a good webmaster. The web site loading speed is amazing. It seems that you are doing any unique trick. Furthermore, The contents are masterwork. you&#39;ve performed a wonderful task on this topic! </p>
<p><em>- finance, 2018</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks <em>finance</em>! It&#39;s a static site served from Github pages so I am not surprised to learn it&#39;s fast! Furthermore, I wrote my own CSS (with a couple bits copy/pasted from a framework) and there&#39;s almost no JavaScript on the site. It&#39;s quite simple really, just keep it light &amp; static. I&#39;m glad the performance does not go unnoticed! As for the contents being a &quot;masterwork,&quot; well, I&#39;ll have to leave that for the Nobel committee to judge.</p>

<p><em>- student loans, 2018</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the update <em>student loans</em>! I was wondering why you hadn&#39;t finished reading, but it makes sense now. Nothing is more important than your health, so (this goes for all my readers) if you find yourself excessively hungry, thirsty, or tired while reading one of my posts, <em>take a break!</em> It will be here when you get back, I promise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This site was... how do you say it? Relevant!! Finally I&#39;ve found something which helped me.</p>

Seriously. many thanks for starting this up. This site is one thing that&#39;s needed on the internet, someone with a bit of originality!</p>
<p><em>- importance of education, 2019</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This type of feedback is what keeps me doing this when it seems &quot;pointless,&quot; which it does at time. In particular I appreciate what you said about &quot;someone with a bit of originality.&quot; <em>Seriously.</em> Thank you <em>importance of education</em>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is really fascinating, You&#39;re an excessively professional blogger. I&#39;ve joined your feed and stay up for looking for more of your excellent post. Also, I have shared your website in my social networks</p>

<p><em>student loans</em>! You&#39;re back!! How was breakfast? You&#39;ll be happy to know, incidentally, that I have added an RSS feed (at the request of a reader!), which you can find <a href="/rss.xml">here</a>.</p>

<p>You know what, <em>Recommended website</em>? Your comment made <em>my</em> day. Thank you.</p>

<p>Do you mind if I quote a couple of your posts as long as I provide credit and sources back to your webpage? My blog is in the very same niche as yours and my visitors would truly benefit from a lot of the information you provide here. Please let me know if this okay with you. Thanks!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Not at all, <em>best sandwich in North Carolina</em>! Provided you include attribution, I&#39;ve no issue with quoting my work. If you can avoid copying posts from start to finish I would appreciate it, but short of that, go ham!</p>
<p>Speaking of pork, I am thrilled to get comments from the Old North State, my home sweet home! Go Heels!!</p>
<hr />

<p>With that, I&#39;ll wrap up this little tribute to my loyal and enthusiastic spam commenters. Thanks again to everyone, and if you wish to contact me it&#39;s still possible! My email address can be found on the <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</p>
<p>Happy spamming!</p>
