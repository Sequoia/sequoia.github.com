Here&#39;s a short collection of tips on maximizing value and minimizing stress at your next conference outing. Let me know if they help, or if you have tips to add. Happy conferencing!</p>
<h2 id="-bring-food">ü•ó Bring Food</h2>
<p>When I arrive in a new town for a conference I will be spending more that one night at, immediately after checking into the hotel I head to the grocery store for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kefir (a &quot;probiotic&quot; fermented milk drink)</li>
<li>Fruit</li>
<li>Bread</li>
<li>Cheese</li>
<li>Yogurt</li>
</ul>
<p>Plane travel, being in a new place, eating out three times a day&mdash;this is all hard on your body! I like to have kefir because I believe that probiotic foods like kefir &amp; yogurt help with digestion (do they? I have no idea! But I <em>believe</em> they do üòÖ).</p>
<p>Conferences are catered but many hotel or venue catering services, well, leave something to be desired. In particular, breakfasts can be rough: pastries, fruit, more pastries... you get the idea. Eating a healthy breakfast <em>that makes you feel good</em> is more than just a luxury when travelling, it can be the difference between having a good morning and a crummy one. Take care of your body at meal-time and it will take care of you later!</p>
<p>Eating out (or catered) three times a day can be taxing on your brain and your wallet. When you&#39;re tired, need food, relaxing alone in your hotel can sound a lot more appealing than hitting the street in search of a burger. That&#39;s where the fruit, bread, and cheese come in: when you need food and a quiet break, you have a meal ready in your hotel room!</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider eat probiotics or other things that settle your stomach</li>
<li>Don&#39;t be 100% reliant on conference catering</li>
<li>Have a meal or two on hand to save money and brainwaves when you&#39;re tired &amp; hungry</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-pace-yourself-">üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pace Yourself!</h2>
<p>The first couple conferences I went to, I had my <em>whole</em> day planned out: this talk at 9:00am, that one at 10:00, then 11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00... this is crazy! Even if there are ten talks you are just dying to see on a certain day, remember: <strong>there&#39;s a limit to how much you can take in</strong>. If you do attend eight talks in a day, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll be able to really focus and take in what you&#39;re hearing at all eight. Rather than power through eight talks in a day, pick four and give each of them your full attention&mdash;you&#39;ll get more out of it on balance.</p>
<p>I know the <abbr title="Fear Of Missing Out">FOMO</abbr> is strong, but no matter how hard you try I guarantee you&#39;ll be missing something, so take my advice and stop worrying about it! Rather than stressing about everything you &quot;missed,&quot; you&#39;ll have a much better time if you set realistic expectations and give yourself breaks. So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Limit the number of talks you see in a day to something reasonable (for me this is about 4 talks)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t worry about missing talks! There are always more talks. üòä</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-put-your-laptop-away">üë©‚Äçüíª Put Your Laptop Away</h2>
<p>It&#39;s tempting to google the tool the framework being presented, check twitter, email, try to run the code examples etc.. <strong>You do not need to travel to a conference to do this</strong> and as such, it is (in my opinion) a poor use of conference time. If you&#39;re watching a talk, tune in and pay attention! I guarantee you&#39;ll get more out of it. If the talk is really so uninteresting that you don&#39;t feel the need to pay attention, why stay? There are usually better places to sit and work than an auditorium seat.</p>
<h2 id="-take-notes-on-paper">üìù Take Notes on Paper</h2>
<p>Taking notes is a great way to remember what you heard, note things you want to look up later, and to capture follow-up questions. Why not take notes on your computer? Because when you get out your computer, <strong>it&#39;s really hard to stick to just taking notes</strong>. You probably have better self-control than me, but when I&#39;m taking notes on my computer, and I have a question about something, and the talk is going sort of slow, and it will only take just a second to find the answer on google.....</p>
<p>Carrying a pen or pencil and a <a href="http://bulletjournal.com/">notebook</a> is a great strategy for those of us who are easily distracted by the wide internet. If you&#39;ve never tried this remove-the-temptation strategy, <strong>you may be surprised how much more you get you get out of a talk when you give it 100% of your attention</strong>. Paper notes are also useful when you&#39;re chatting at the after-party: easily recall notes and questions without having to whip out your laptop!</p>
