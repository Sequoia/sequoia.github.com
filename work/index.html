<h2 id="training">Training</h2>
<p>I have experience teaching programming tools and practices in both corporate and
non-profit contexts. In addition to running trainings, I&#39;ve done content work
ranging from <strong>content updates</strong> &amp; <strong>technical review</strong> to ground-up <strong>curriculum authoring</strong> and <strong>hands-on instruction</strong> for
clients such as <a href="https://www.oreilly.com">O&#39;Reilly</a> and <a href="strongloop.com/">IBM/StrongLoop</a>.</p>
<p>I can quickly bring your team up to speed and provide hands-on training on topics including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js application architecture, development, and advanced debugging </li>
<li>Front-end JavaScript &amp; framework selection &amp; use</li>
<li>Effective processes and systems for teams (Agile, pull-request workflow, documentation, etc.)</li>
<li>Internet of Things</li>
</ul>

<p>Great job of efficiently explaining and visualizing concepts in minimalistic fashion‚Äîand having the start / done repos per slide deck!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Sequoia] walking around asking if people needed help was pretty awesome, considering most of the dev folks (read &#39;me&#39;) can be a bit introverted, and not ask for help outright.</p>

<p>Great work with the slides and exercises. I can tell a lot of thought was put into it and it shows. It was great how Sequoia kept walking around seeing if we had any questions.</p>

<h2 id="software-development">Software Development</h2>
<p>With experience across multiple platforms including JavaScript/HTML/CSS, Node.js, Java, and PHP, I am able to jump into a wide variety of technical environments and become productive quickly. Whether you need someone to take <strong>full ownership of a project</strong> from kickoff to delivery, <strong>expert advice</strong> on picking technologies and writing a development plan, or you need help <strong>putting out fires</strong> ASAP, I can help.</p>
<p>Technologies I am experienced with include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js: Express, LoopBack, Core APIS (http, streams, etc.) </li>
<li>Browser technologies (JavaScript/ES6+, HTML, CSS)</li>
<li>AngularJS, Mithril, Knockout.js, Rx.js, jQuery, etc.</li>
<li>PHP: Laravel, CakePHP, Slim, Wordpress, etc.</li>
<li>Java: Wicket, Tomcat</li>
<li>AWS: Lambda, S3, etc.</li>
<li>Linux server administration</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="open-source-help-desk">Open Source Help Desk</h2>
<p>Open Source Software is great! No licensing fees, free community support, and constant innovation.</p>
<p>You may find, however, that when you&#39;re completely stuck, &quot;free community support&quot; doesn&#39;t cut it. After hours or days spent seeking help on forums, mailing lists, and Github issue trackers, it becomes clear that the old &quot;pay for software/get access to a professional help-desk&quot; model wasn&#39;t all bad!</p>
<p>My <strong>Open Source Help Desk</strong> services fill that gap. When you are using Express, Laravel, React, or another popular framework and you need your support request moved to the front of the line and resolved fully, I can help. Platforms I can provide Help Desk support for include <strong>JavaScript (browser)</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>PHP</strong>. I have expert level experience with a variety of frameworks using these platforms including <strong>Express.js</strong>, <strong>Laravel</strong>, and <strong>LoopBack</strong>, and I&#39;m able to support any OS JavaScript framework as long as its documentation is available online.</p>
