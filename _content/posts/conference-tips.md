I've travelled to a good number of tech conferences over the years, and I've learned a few things along the way! Here's a short collection of tips on maximizing value and minimizing stress at your next conference outing. Let me know if they help, or if you have tips to add. Happy conferencing!

## ü•ó Bring Food

When I arrive in a new town for a conference I will be spending more that one night at, immediately after checking into the hotel I head to the grocery store for:

* Kefir (a "probiotic" fermented milk drink)
* Fruit
* Bread
* Cheese
* Yogurt

Plane travel, being in a new place, eating out three times a day&mdash;this is all hard on your body! I like to have kefir because I believe that probiotic foods like kefir & yogurt help with digestion (do they? I have no idea! But I *believe* they do üòÖ).

Conferences are catered but many hotel or venue catering services, well, leave something to be desired. In particular, breakfasts can be rough: pastries, fruit, more pastries... you get the idea. Eating a healthy breakfast *that makes you feel good* is more than just a luxury when travelling, it can be the difference between having a good morning and a crummy one. Take care of your body at meal-time and it will take care of you later!

Eating out (or catered) three times a day can be taxing on your brain and your wallet. When you're tired, need food, relaxing alone in your hotel can sound a lot more appealing than hitting the street in search of a burger. That's where the fruit, bread, and cheese come in: when you need food and a quiet break, you have a meal ready in your hotel room!

To summarize:

1. Consider eat probiotics or other things that settle your stomach
2. Don't be 100% reliant on conference catering
3. Have a meal or two on hand to save money and brainwaves when you're tired & hungry

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Pace Yourself!

The first couple conferences I went to, I had my *whole* day planned out: this talk at 9:00am, that one at 10:00, then 11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00... this is crazy! Even if there are ten talks you are just dying to see on a certain day, remember: **there's a limit to how much you can take in**. If you do attend eight talks in a day, it's unlikely you'll be able to really focus and take in what you're hearing at all eight. Rather than power through eight talks in a day, pick four and give each of them your full attention&mdash;you'll get more out of it on balance.

I know the <abbr title="Fear Of Missing Out">FOMO</abbr> is strong, but no matter how hard you try I guarantee you'll be missing something, so take my advice and stop worrying about it! Rather than stressing about everything you "missed," you'll have a much better time if you set realistic expectations and give yourself breaks. So:

1. Limit the number of talks you see in a day to something reasonable (for me this is about 4 talks)
2. Don't worry about missing talks! There are always more talks. üòä

## üë©‚Äçüíª Put Your Laptop Away

It's tempting to google the tool the framework being presented, check twitter, email, try to run the code examples etc.. **You do not need to travel to a conference to do this** and as such, it is (in my opinion) a poor use of conference time. If you're watching a talk, tune in and pay attention! I guarantee you'll get more out of it. If the talk is really so uninteresting that you don't feel the need to pay attention, why stay? There are usually better places to sit and work than an auditorium seat.

## üìù Take Notes on Paper

Taking notes is a great way to remember what you heard, note things you want to look up later, and to capture follow-up questions. Why not take notes on your computer? Because when you get out your computer, **it's really hard to stick to just taking notes**. You probably have better self-control than me, but when I'm taking notes on my computer, and I have a question about something, and the talk is going sort of slow, and it will only take just a second to find the answer on google.....

Carrying a pen or pencil and a [notebook](http://bulletjournal.com/) is a great strategy for those of us who are easily distracted by the wide internet. If you've never tried this remove-the-temptation strategy, **you may be surprised how much more you get you get out of a talk when you give it 100% of your attention**. Paper notes are also useful when you're chatting at the after-party: easily recall notes and questions without having to whip out your laptop!
