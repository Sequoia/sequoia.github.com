I’m wondering why these guide cards were made if they’re not supposed to be used anywhere.
Always allow for the possibility that there is no reason they were made. Chesterton’s Fence says to understand why something is there before changing it, but I amend that to add that “perhaps the fence was blown here by the wind, perhaps it fell off a truck, perhaps there’s no particular reason it’s here”
