# Hardware

* Kit I bought
    * Cheaper kits?
    * Overkill? Would a less powerful pi work? Probably
* HDD I bought
    * SSD vs. HDD
    * POWER: make sure it doesn't draw more current than your pie needs

# Software

* Plex
    * Vs. Kodi etc.
    * Still a bit confused on some of these points
* Debian
    * Could have used plex distro but didn't

# To transcode or not to transcodee
1.  "Let server transcode" 
    * does not work on pi, not powerful enough
    * note from Reddit about how much PC Points per 1080p stream
2.  "Make client accommodate server"

# Additional configurations for my setup

* Pinning IP address on my router
    * Not essential, but more convenient
* Spinning HDD down
