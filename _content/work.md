## Training

I have experience teaching programming tools and practices in both corporate and
non-profit contexts. In addition to running trainings, I've done content work
ranging from updates & technical review to ground-up curriculum authoring for
clients such as
[O'Reilly](conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/javascript-html-us/public/schedule/detail/47786)
and [StrongLoop](https://strongloop.com/node-js/training/galvanize-2015/).
