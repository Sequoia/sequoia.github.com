Yesterday I was a part of two different discussions about improvements to technical systems at my company. In each case, there was a lofty ideal goal for the improvements, and in each case this goal was likely unachievable from our current position. Getting to the "lofty ideal goal" was simply too big a jump from our current state. Rather than formulating plans to reach the "lofty ideal goals," in both discussions I outlined **small improvement** that we could realistically achieve in the near term. 

Rather than making a **big** plan to jump to the ideal state of the system, I opted for making a **small** plan that makes each system **a little better than it is today**. While considering the fact that the same approach worked in both cases (and has worked for me in the past), it occured to that not only is this a more practical approach to improving complex systems, but in fact it is the only approach that works. **Incremental progress is all there is**.

In considering counter-examples, I tried to think of major "big jump" changes and the American Revolutionary War came to mind as a change that was (literally) revolution rather than evolution. Rather than the slow incremental separation from Briton such as Canada or other commonwealth nations experienced, the thirteen colonies that would be the United States broke away all at once and changed their society fundamentally in one fell swoop. Or did they?

If you were a slave in Virginia, the revolution would have had little impact on your station in life. The slave was still enslaved, wealthy, well-educated white men still held power (*almost* the same ones as had held power before), and even for most non-slaves, life would be much the same. The right to vote was held by
