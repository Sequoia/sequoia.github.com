Is there any logic to what you “take” in English? When my Brazilian coworkers say they will “take” an espresso, I explain you can “get” or “buy” an espresso, but should not “take” one. (It sounds like you’re gonna steal it!)

Later one of them said “let’s go to a walk” & I had to explain that unlike a coffee, you *do* “take” a walk. English! I can't take it anymore!
