title: Hello There!
---
My name's Sequoia and you can learn a bit about what I do here. If you
are the money-for-work-paying type, you can get more info here:
[linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/smcdowell). If you find yourself on
irc.freenode.net, I'm `diamonds`, and if you want to write the old fashioned
way, I use gmail with the name `sequoia.mcdowell`. Drop me a line and say hi!

Out of respect for your privacy, I do not use google analytics or other third
party scripts that track you on my site.  This means that I have *no idea* that
you've visited unless you tell me (site hosted on github).  So if you read an
article and liked it, tell me so using one of the methods above!
