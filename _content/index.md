title: Hello There!

My name's Sequoia, I'm a [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)
developer and educator, and you can find out a bit about what I do here on this website!

Out of respect for your privacy, I do not use google analytics or other third
party scripts that track you on my site.  This means that I have *no idea* that
you've visited unless you tell me (site hosted on github).  So if you read an
article and liked it, tell me via the [contact page](/contact) in the comments
form on posts. Thanks in advance and happy coding!
