Incorporate the theme 'Invent the disease and you can sell the cure.' Add a  hopeful reflection at the end so it's not too negative-sounding.</p><h3><time>January 25, 2021</time><a href="/kubernetes-resource-optimization-just-the-basics/" class="title">Kubernetes Resource Optimization: Just The Basics</a></h3><p>How do you write about optimizing Kubernetes clusters without getting into the weeds? The whole thing is just weeds. Nonetheless, there are things you can do to reduce your kubernetes spend and maintain performance without an advanced degree in Kubernetology, and I'll go over some of those things in this post!</p><h3><time>January 5, 2021</time><a href="/reducing-docker-image-size-particularly-for-kubernetes-environments/" class="title">Reducing Docker Image Size (Particularly for Kubernetes Environments)</a></h3><p>While a few hundred megabytes in an application image seems a small concern in this day and age, when you're running scores or hundreds of instances in a cluster environments such as Kuberenetes, those megabytes start to add up. This can lead to spending more than needed on infrastructure, CI builds taking longer, and performance issues during cluster scaling. Read this post for a few simple tricks to slim down your docker image.</p><h3><time>December 21, 2020</time><a href="/parsing-json-at-the-cli-a-practical-introduction-to-jq-and-more/" class="title">Parsing JSON at the CLI: A Practical Introduction to `jq` (and more!)</a></h3><p>JSON is everywhere you look these days.
